My first project NodeJS

**Overview**

This project is a simple Node.js API that uses middleware to handle requests and responses. It stores data in a db.json file and allows for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data.

**Features**

**Middleware:** Handles JSON request bodies and routes requests based on HTTP methods and paths.

**Data Persistence**: Data is stored in a db.json file to ensure persistence across application restarts.

**Easy to Use**: Provides a simple interface for querying and managing data.
